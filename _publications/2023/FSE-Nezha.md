  Root cause analysis (RCA) in large-scale microservice systems is a critical and challenging task. To understand and localize root causes of unexpected faults, modern observability tools collect and preserve multi-modal observability data, including metrics, traces, and logs. Since system faults may manifest as anomalies in different data sources, existing RCA approaches that rely on single-modal data are constrained in the granularity and interpretability of root causes. In this study, we present Nezha, an interpretable and fine-grained RCA approach that pinpoints root causes at the code region and resource type level by incorporative analysis of multi-modal data. Nezha transforms heterogeneous multi-modal data into a homogeneous event representation and extracts event patterns by constructing and mining event graphs. The core idea of Nezha is to compare event patterns in the fault-free phase with those in the fault-suffering phase to localize root causes in an interpretable way. Practical implementation and experimental evaluations on two microservice applications show that Nezha achieves a high top1 accuracy (87.5%) on average at the code region and resource type level and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. Two ablation studies further confirm the contributions of incorporating multi-modal data.
